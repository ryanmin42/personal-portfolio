    <h1 class="title">Landing a Co-op Job</h1>
    <h3>March 5, 2018</h3>
    <div class="text">
    <p>So, the first round of co-op matchings is over, and for many of us
      (including me), getting a job is a lot harder than we thought it would be.
      From 20+ required programming languages to GPA requirements to hundreds
      of job applicants, the hurdles you have to go through to find
      the right job can be endless. But, we all get matched eventually,
      and here are some helpful strategies I've found during this round.</p>
    <br>
    <strong><p>Only apply to jobs you're actually interested in.</p></strong>
    <p>During the job posting cycle, it can be tempting to "Cali/Google or Bust"
      because that's what everyone else is doing. If that's your thing, great.
      If not, think about what jobs would actually interest or benefit you and
      apply to those, instead of what's popular. If you're genuinely interested
      in the jobs you apply to, this will accomplish two things. a) You will
      come across as a lot more genuine to recruiters
      and probably do better in your applications & interviews, and b) you'll
      learn a lot more from and enjoy the positions you take.</p>
    <br>
    <strong><p>Make yourself stand out.</p></strong>
    <p>When preparing resumes, many of my friends were concerned with things
      like getting the nicest font or aligning that last sentence. While this
      certainly helps, recruiters only spend 10 seconds looking at your resume.
      If you want them to choose you, you should highlight your experiences in
      a way that makes them the most unique. What projects and languages/
      frameworks have you worked with that most of your friends haven't?
      If you have prior work experience, what's a task that your employer
      challenged you with that you solved in a unique way? Remember that your
      experiences will make you unique, not your academic program as there might
      be dozens of hundreds of other applicants in similar programs.</p>
          <br>
    <strong><p>Variety, Variety, Variety</p></strong>
    <p>Your projects are an important part of your resume. They highlight your
      experience and show how you approach problems. The projects that you show
      on your resume should demonstrate a good mix of breadth and depth. Show
      that you're passionate about a certain issue, and can tackle it from
      multiple approaches. For example, if you're into finance and blockchain,
      mention a mobile app, desktop app and webapp you've developed to address
      something in finance. Doing this will not only show that you're well
      rounded & skilled in many areas, but also that you're always eager to
      learn new skills.</p>
    <br>
    <strong><p>Follow up.</p></strong>
    <p>This tip especially applies to jobs with hundreds of applicants.
      Sometimes, recruiters will run out of time and won't even read a lot of
      the submitted resumes. This can suck, because it becomes a matter of luck
      as to who gets the interviews. If you really want the position, take the
      time to look up the recruiters' names on WaterlooWorks and then on
      LinkedIn or Google. Shoot them a quick email. At worst, they won't
      respond/consider you, and at best, they'll appreciate your initiative and
      invite you to an interview.</p>
    <br>
    <strong><p>Know the company like your own.</p></strong>
    <p>Congrats! You've got the interview! You're halfway there, but don't slack
      just yet. I've always thought of interviewing like another course or
      midterm to prepare for, and that involves doing your homework. Anyone can
      do technical questions, but the applicants that shine are the ones who can
      demonstrate they're a good fit for the company. Researching the company is
      more than just knowing their history. You've got to have an in-depth
      understanding of how they function on a daily basis. What kind of projects
      do they work on? How do they view their relationship with their customers?
      What opportunities are they taking advantage of in the digital age? The
      better you can explain these things and relate them to your own
      experiences, the more you'll stand out in the eyes of a recruiter.</p>
